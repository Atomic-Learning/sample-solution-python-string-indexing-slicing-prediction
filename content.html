<p>The cells below show the results of various string indexing and slicing operations in Python. The comments describe which characters will be returned in words to explain the output.</p>

<py-cell>
string = "Python"
#         012345  (indices)


print(string[0])      # First character
print(string[2])      # Third character
print(string[-1])     # Last character
</py-cell>

<p>Now let's try some slices to extract parts of the string.</p>

<py-cell>
print(string[1:4])    # indices 1, 2, 3
print(string[0:3])    # indices 0, 1, 2
print(string[-2:])    # last 2 characters
</py-cell>

<p>We can use steps to return every $n$th character, or reverse the string.</p>

<py-cell>
print(string[::2])    # every other character
print(string[1::3])   # every 3rd character starting from index 1
print(string[::-1])   # reversed
</py-cell>

<py-cell>
print(string[0])      # first character
print(string[-1])     # last character
print(string[1:4])    # indices 1, 2, 3
print(string[::3])    # every 3rd character
print(string[1:6:2])  # start 1, stop 6 (exclusive), step 2
print(string[-3:])    # last 3 characters
</py-cell>
